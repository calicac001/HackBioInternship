# 👩🏻‍🔬 HackBio Internship

This repository contains my work from the [HackBio Internship](https://internship.thehackbio.com/internship) program.  

HackBio provides team-based, project-driven training in bioinformatics with a focus on coding, data analysis, and modern biological research methods.  

## 🧬 Current Track: NGS Fundamentals

The **NGS Fundamentals** internship was divided into three main stages, each focused on building foundational skills in computational biology and sequencing analysis.

### 1. Coding for Bio: Linux & Bash Fundamentals
Learn how to use **Bash**, a powerful and efficient scripting language widely used for building bioinformatics pipelines and automating repetitive tasks.

📌 Contents:  
- Linux command-line basics  
- File management and navigation  
- Writing and executing Bash scripts  

### 2. NGS Fundamentals: RNA Sequencing
Gain hands-on experience in analyzing and interpreting **RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)** data, a gateway to understanding gene expression, disease biology, and modern drug discovery.  

📌 Contents:  
- FASTQ file handling and quality control  
- Read alignment and quantification  
- Differential gene expression analysis  

### 3. NGS Fundamentals: Whole Genome Sequencing
Explore how **whole genome sequencing (WGS)** drives discoveries in genetics, personalized medicine, and biotechnology—with beginner-friendly, practical training.  

📌 Contents:  
- Quality control of raw sequencing reads  
- Reference genome alignment  
- Variant calling and annotation
